                            Weight loss is a totally achievable goal provided you are ready to put in the required
                            amount of time and effort. Together, exercise and proper diet can help you lose weight
                            effectively. If you want to see results in a shorter time, you’ll need to plan your
                            exercises to maximize calorie burning. However, a balanced approach is necessary to allow
                            you to burn more calories while preventing you from pushing yourself too hard.

                            Some exercises that are great for weight loss include:

                            <li class="blog-li"> <strong class="color-grn"> Cycling </strong> - Cycling can help you burn lots of calories. This low impact form of exercise
                                won’t harm your joints, but the more work you put in the more effective it will be.
                                Cycle uphill, increase your speed or add resistance to maximize calorie burning. At
                                12-14 miles an hour, it’s possible to burn up to 600 calories in that time.

                                <strong class="color-grn"> Running </strong> - Running is no easy task, but it works. You can’t go wrong with this exercise
                                for calorie burning and weight loss. To further increase its effectiveness, run uphill
                                and run fast.
                            </li>

                                <strong class="color-grn"> Swimming </strong> - A large amount of calories can be burned with swimming. Your swimming speed
                                and body weight will determine how much fat you burn. A half-hour session of vigorous
                                swimming can burn up to 372 calories.

                                <strong class="color-grn"> Skipping </strong> - Weight loss can be achieved by introducing skipping into your exercise
                                routine. Jogging for 20 minutes gets you the same result as skipping for just half that
                                time. It is great to get better core stability and burn lots of calories. Be careful not
                                to skip at high intensity for long periods, though. Gradually increase the intensity and
                                duration as you build stamina.

                                <strong class="color-grn"> Anaerobic </strong> resistance training - Build your strength and muscles through strength
                                training. Anaerobic exercise is done using bands, weights, body weight or resistance
                                tubes. Include resistance training exercises in your workout plan twice a week so that
                                you can burn more fat as well as prevent future weight gain.
