                            To build strong muscles, incorporate some basic strategies for muscle gain into your workout
                            regimen. In order to get maximum results from your exercise plan, sometimes you have to get
                            off the beaten path and pay attention to what your body is signalling.

                                Muscle mass increases when you take extra calories to promote muscle growth. The surplus
                                will help fuel your training and maintain your weight at the current figure, paving the
                                way for more muscle.

                                by lifting heavy weights. The muscle fibres suffer microscopic tears which causes the

                                Your body is programmed to do everything for a reason, so it needs to have a reason
                                to trigger muscle gain, such as a survival advantage. Weight training should be done
                                by gradually increasing the weights you lift and continuing to do so progressively.
                                This will convince your body that it is in your best interest to get stronger and
                                bigger.

                                selection, rest time, rep ranges or sets. You can even set a new fitness goal.
