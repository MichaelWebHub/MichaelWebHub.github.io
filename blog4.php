                            You might be one of those unlucky fitness enthusiasts who are unable to develop a muscular
                            physique even after years of working out. Try the following strategies for chest
                            enhancement, bulking up and increasing muscle mass:

                                motivated to build muscle mass if it experiences tiny muscle fibre tears. These are made
                                possible by heavy weight lifting so as to force your body into reacting with new muscle
                                growth.

                                <strong class="color-grn"> Opt for multi-joint exercises </strong> - You can lift much
                                more weight during multi-joint exercises compared to single-joint ones. These workouts
                                include squats, deadlifts and bench presses.

                                <strong class="color-grn"> Add weights </strong> - If your body is getting comfortable
                                with the amount of weight you’re currently lifting, you’re not encouraging muscle growth
                                anymore. Add on more weight each time this happens.

                                <strong class="color-grn"> Drop the cardio </strong> - Muscle building requires a
                                surplus of calories. If you are burning a large amount of calories with cardio
                                exercises, your body won’t have enough left for muscle mass growth. Muscle mass
                                increases when you have a caloric surplus. Cardio workouts burn a large amount of
                                calories and you may not have extra calories to promote muscle building.

                                <strong class="color-grn"> Increase your intake </strong> - It takes about 3,500 extra
                                calories – sourced from healthy fat, protein and carbohydrates – to build a pound of
                                muscle, so eat more healthy foods like avocadoes, sweet potatoes and organic beef.

                                <strong class="color-grn"> Use supplements </strong> - Creatine and protein powder are
                                the best sources of supplements for muscle building. Beta alanine, nitric oxide and
                                other popular supplements have a smaller effect.

                                <strong class="color-grn"> Keep your training time short </strong> - High intensity is
                                more important than training for longer durations. Training for more than an hour every
                                day won’t necessarily result in more muscle.

                                requires that you continue to steadily progress in your workout plan. Increase the
                                number of reps or lift heavier weights.

                                hitting a plateau, keep changing your rep range every month. This way your body won’t
                                get accustomed to it and will continue to respond to the workout with muscle gain.
